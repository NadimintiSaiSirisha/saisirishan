                <h3>About me:</h3>
                <p>
                    I am currently doing my Masters in Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from IIIT Hyderabad. I completed my B.E. degree from Mumbai Univesity in Computer Engineering in 2019. I was the first ranker across all branches in my college. My BE Project,
                    "Charity-Chain " was based on building a charity system based on Blockchain. I also did a side-project of building a Smart Electricity Consumption system using IoT. I published three papers based on my projects, whose links can be
                    found
                    <a href="index.html#Publications ">here</a>. Both of my projects were accepted for minor grant from Mumbai University.
                    <br><br> I got a wonderful opportunity of working in BARC, Mumbai in Department of Remote Handling and Robotics, after which I got an inclination towards research. The project was based on detecting the fiducials for neuro surgery.
                    Working there was an amazing experience.
                    <br>
                    <br> After my BE, I worked in a software company for a period of 5 months, where I learnt various skills. My job was to build products using C# .NET framework, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I will always be thankful to my senior collegues
                    and peers for supporting me to pursue my dreams.
                    <br>
                    <br> In my free time, I like reading books, cooking and gardening.

                    My BE Project involved Blockchain Technology to eradicate corruption and increase the trust in charity systems and transparency in public organizations so that the funds and donations reach the end user safely. I realised that this technology has the
                    capability to eradicate many issues that our country is currently facing and it can impact the economy in a positive way. I have also worked on a project that aims to bring transparency in the electricity system for the end customer
                    so that he/she will know the real-time utilisation of the power with respect to each device. This will help him/her to judiciously utilise the electricity resources and save the electricity expenditure.
                    <br>
                    <br> I enjoyed searching for solutions for the problem statements and during the process of writing the papers, I understood that it is not only important to know about the emerging technologies, but it is equally important to utilise
                    the knowledge in bringing a social impact. In my BE course, I have studied various domains like Image Processing, IoT Systems and Big Data Analysis in and would really like to use these topics to develop solutions to solve real-life
                    problems.
